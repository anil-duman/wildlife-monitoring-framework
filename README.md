# Wildlife Monitoring Deep Learning Framework

A deep learning-based framework for automated wildlife monitoring using camera trap imagery.

## Overview

This project implements machine learning techniques for wildlife species classification and analysis from camera trap images. The framework includes modules for species identification, temporal pattern analysis, and anomaly detection.

## Features

- Automated species classification using deep learning
- Temporal and spatial activity pattern analysis
- Anomaly detection for identifying unusual observations
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualization tools

## Dataset

Evaluated on camera trap imagery featuring various animal species with associated metadata including timestamps and location information.

## Requirements

- python
- torch
- torchvision
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Pillow
- tqdm

## Installation

```bash
